	<p> lol. Mondays suck. Wanna know a fun fact? I've been at school three weeks now and I've almost <br> gained 10 pounds I came in weighing about 124 and now I'm 128lbs. What a shame. Guess I'm gonna have to change my diet now... SIKE.<br> I love eating way too much if I have a gut oh well. Whoever my husband is, I know he'll love me for me. </p> </div>
